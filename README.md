# ufbx [![CI](https://github.com/bqqbarbhg/ufbx/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bqqbarbhg/ufbx/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ufbx/ufbx/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ufbx/ufbx)

Single source file FBX file loader?

```cpp
ufbx_load_opts opts = { 0 }; // Optional, pass NULL for defaults
ufbx_error error; // Optional, pass NULL if you don't care about errors
ufbx_scene *scene = ufbx_load_file("thing.fbx", &opts, &error);
if (!scene) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to load: %s\n", error.description.data);
    exit(1);
}

// Use and inspect `scene`, it's just plain data!

// Let's just list all objects within the scene for example:
for (size_t i = 0; i < scene->nodes.count; i++) {
    ufbx_node *node = scene->nodes.data[i];
    if (node->is_root) continue;

    printf("Object: %s\n", node->name.data);
    if (node->mesh) {
        printf("-> mesh with %zu faces\n", node->mesh->faces.count);
    }
}

ufbx_free_scene(scene);
```

## Documentation

[Online documentation](https://ufbx.github.io/)

## Setup

Copy `ufbx.h` and `ufbx.c` to your project, `ufbx.c` needs to be compiled as
C99/C++11 or more recent. You can also add `misc/ufbx.natvis` to get debug
formatting for the types.

## Features

The goal is to be at feature parity with the official FBX SDK.

* Supports binary and ASCII FBX files starting from version 3000
* Safe
  * Invalid files and out-of-memory conditions are handled gracefully
  * Loaded scenes are sanitized by default, no out-of-bounds indices or non-UTF-8 strings
  * Extensively [tested](#testing)
* Various object types
  * Meshes, skinning, blend shapes
  * Lights and cameras
  * Embedded textures
  * NURBS curves and surfaces
  * Geometry caches
  * LOD groups
  * Display/selection sets
  * Rigging constraints
* Unified PBR material from known vendor-specific materials
* Various utilities for evaluating the scene (can be compiled out if not needed)
  * Polygon triangulation
  * Index generation
  * Animation curve evaluation / layer blending
  * CPU skinning evaluation
  * Subdivision surface evaluation
  * NURBS curve/surface tessellation
* Progress reporting and cancellation
* Support for Wavefront `.obj` files as well

## Platforms

The library is written in portable C (also compiles as C++) and should work on
almost any platform without modification. If compiled as pre-C11/C++11 on an
unknown compiler (not MSVC/Clang/GCC/TCC), some functions will not be
thread-safe as C99 does not have support for atomics.

The following platforms are tested on CI and produce bit-exact results:

* Windows: MSVC x64/x86, Clang x64/x86, GCC MinGW x64
* macOS: Clang x64, GCC x64
* Linux: Clang x64/x86/ARM64/ARM32/PowerPC, GCC x64/x86/ARM64/ARM32, TCC x64/x86
* WASI: Clang WASM

## Testing

* Internal tests run on all platforms listed above
  * 592 test cases / 604 FBX files
* Fuzzed in multiple layers
  * Parsers (fbx binary/fbx ascii/deflate/xml/mcx/obj/mtl) fuzzed using AFL
  * Structured FBX binary/ascii fuzzing using AFL
  * Built-in fuzzing for byte modifications/truncation/out-of-memory
  * Semantic fuzzing for binary FBX and OBJ files
* Public dataset: 4.7GB / 323 files
  * Loaded, validated, and compared against reference .obj files
* Private dataset: 33.6GB / 12618 files
  * Loaded and validated
* Static analysis for maximum stack depth on Linux GCC/Clang
* In total 95% branch line coverage (99% partial line coverage)

## Versioning

The latest commit in the [`master`](https://github.com/ufbx/ufbx/tree/master)
branch contains the latest stable version of the library.

Older versions are tagged as `vX.Y.Z`, patch updates (`Z`) are ABI compatible
and work with older versions of the header from the same minor version (`Y`).
Minor versions within a major verision (`X`) are expected to be source
compatible after `1.0.0` but the `0.Y.Z` releases can break for every minor
release.
